Overview of the project:

objective

Accurately measuring and tracking ambient conditions in real-time is the goal of temperature and humidity monitoring with a DHT sensor. This sensor is frequently utilised in many different applications, including home automation, agricultural monitoring, and climate control systems. The DHT sensor offers accurate temperature and humidity data by integrating with a microcontroller, allowing for prompt responses to changes in the surrounding environment. The information gathered can be recorded, examined, and applied to improve the environment in certain settings, guaranteeing efficiency, comfort, and safety.

Key Activities

Sensor Integration:To make data collecting easier, connect the DHT sensor to a microcontroller or development board.
Data Acquisition:setting up the microcontroller to periodically read humidity and temperature information from the sensor.
 Data Logging: archiving the collected data for further examination and observation in a local or cloud-based storage system.
Data Analysis:To find trends, abnormalities, or patterns in the temperature and humidity levels, process and analyse the data that has been gathered.
 Real-Time Monitoring: presenting real-time data so that customers may rapidly monitor environmental conditions via a user interface, like an LCD screen, web dashboard, or mobile app.


technologies used
DHT11 sensor: The primary sensor used to measure temperature and humidity levels. 
Microcontroller or Development Board: Devices like Arduino, i2c , LCD are used to interface with the DHT sensor, process data, and control the system.
Data Storage: Local storage or cloud-based databases are used to store the collected data for analysis and long-term monitoring.
Power Supply: Power sources, including batteries, USB power, or solar panels, ensure the system operates continuously, especially in remote or off-grid locations.
